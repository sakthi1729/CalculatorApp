Overview
This project focuses on the UI aspect of a calculator application, arranging number buttons in a familiar layout using Tkinter’s grid system. It includes functions to handle button presses, insert numbers into the display, and arrange the layout with a clean and organized code structure.

Features
Grid Layout for Number Buttons: Creates a 3x3 grid layout for numbers 1-9, with the "0" button positioned beneath them.
Dynamic Button Functions: Each button is bound to a function using a lambda, allowing numbers to be easily displayed when clicked.
Basic Calculator Functionality: Integrates well as part of a larger calculator project by setting up a responsive layout for numeric input.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-tkinter.git
cd calculator-tkinter
Install Python: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python calculator_gui.py
Usage
Run the script to launch the calculator interface.
Click on number buttons to see the respective values displayed in the calculator's display widget.
The layout positions the number buttons in a familiar calculator format, with "0" positioned below the 3x3 grid.
Example
To test the calculator layout, you can extend the code with functions to handle operations (+, -, *, /, etc.), display results, and add additional functionality (clear, backspace).

Code Structure
numbers List: Contains numbers 1-9, iterated over to create the 3x3 button grid.
get_number Function: Inserts numbers into the calculator display.
Button Widgets: Each button is created with a command that uses a lambda to call get_number with the respective number.
Code Snippet
Here is a key part of the code, responsible for creating the number button grid:

python
Copy code
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
counter = 0
for x in range(3):  # Rows
    for y in range(3):  # Columns
        button_text = numbers[counter]
        button = Button(root, text=button_text, width=2, height=2, command=lambda text=button_text: get_number(text))
        button.grid(row=x+2, column=y)
        counter += 1

button = Button(root, text="0", width=2, height=2, command=lambda: get_number(0))
button.grid(row=5, column=1)
This code arranges buttons in a grid layout and binds them to the get_number function, allowing for easy numeric input.
